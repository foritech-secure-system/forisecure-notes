# Backlog (next)
- [ ] Confirm OpenSSL KDF used on backup creation; document **exact** restore command.
- [ ] Prune `authorized_keys` to required minimum; annotate each key with owner/comment.
- [ ] UFW tidy-up (keep /16 for now per decision; later consider /22 minimal).
- [ ] Document full disaster-recovery (restore steps + smoke tests).
- [ ] PKI housekeeping script (no secrets), inventory and rotation policy.
- [ ] Prepare mini-release notes and tag after hygiene pass.
