    # Gap Validation

**Repo URL:** https://github.com/foritech-secure-system/forisecure-notes (access via web not available/likely private)
- What I looked for: existing session notes, planning/backlog, decisions, DNS/infra notes, security notes, TRL/KPI evidence, changelog.
- What I could confirm online: _Not accessible_ (private or non-indexed), so I didn't overwrite anything in the repo.
- What I add in this ZIP: minimal, **non-duplicating** starter set for the above sections so you can drop it into the repo and iterate.
- Secrets policy enforced: no keys/certs/tokens; placeholders like `<REDACTED>` only.


    ## Session Summary (bullets)
    - Context: Consolidate project notes and delivery planning into a clean, secret-free repo (`forisecure-notes`).
    - Decisions today: Keep notes repo lean; enforce no-secrets policy; add planning/evidence scaffolding.
    - Risks/Blockers: Repo visibility (private) prevents auto-scan; ensure team uses templates to avoid drift.
    - Next steps (â‰¤10 lines):
      1) Create repo folder structure from this ZIP and commit.
      2) Wire a simple CI check (markdownlint and lychee link check) on `docs/**` (optional).
      3) Fill **DNS_Infra.md** with actual records (A/AAAA/CNAME/TXT/SPF/DMARC/DKIM) for your domains.
      4) Fill **Security_Notes.md** (DNSSEC/HSTS/redirects, secret rules, rotation cadence).
      5) Populate **TRL7_Readiness.md** with pointers to live demos, logs, screenshots.
      6) Maintain **Backlog.md** and **Decisions.md** after each micro-iteration.
